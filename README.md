# 🐾 Animal Species Predictor (Machine Learning + Django)

A web-based application that uses a machine learning model to predict animal species based on input features. Built with **Django** for the backend and integrated with a trained Keras model.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Predicts animal species from uploaded images
- 🐍 Deep Learning model built using Keras (CNN)
- 🌐 Django web interface with user-friendly upload form
- 💾 SQLite database integration
- 🔐 Admin panel and image history
- 📂 Organized folder structure with model saved as `.h5`
